# What I learned Week-3.

---

In week 3 we started diving into Javascript... So what is Javascript?

**Javascript** - is a high level interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and much more.

Below are some key things that we went over.

##Variables

---

Variables are containers for storing data values. You can declare a variable in Javascript by using one of the examples below:

* let (let age= 2)
* const (const name = 'Dallas')

Strings are written using either single of double quotes and numbers can be used with or without decimals.

---

## Functions

---

A function is a block of code that is used to perform a particular task. This makes it easier to separate your code so that you can do the following:

* Use the same code without repeating yourself.
* Makes it easier to see what that bit of code is doing.
  
  **What a Function looks like.**

  function add() {
      x = x + 1;
  }

  Breaking down the above example:
  * Function declares the function.
  * add is the function name.
  * Inside the curly braces is the code you use to run the function when it is called.
  
  **Remember whatever happens in functions stays in functions!**
